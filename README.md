Just Another Media Server

Just what is JAMS?
It's not _really_ a media server.  There are already plenty of media servers out there; both closed and open source.
There'll be a web interface (probably AJAX), but that's something I expect to run in pretty much any web server.
In fact it probably won't have any actual server bits to it.

So... um, what is it?
JAMS aims to be a complement to an existing media server such as minidlna or mediatome (since those are the two I've been using lately) and provide an easy way for users in the household to upload, manage and consume their video.  I'd like the rest of my family to be able to put videos on our "server" so they don't need to wait on me.

Why?
github is a nice place to back up my project so when I toast my server and backups... oh wait!... I mean to say that github is a great place to share my work with others.

So there's no server... why does it have server in the name?
I'm not very good with picking names for projects... I've spent entirely too much time thing on names... JAMS is easy to remember and you can probably squeeze many 'creative' names outta that if "Just Another Media Server" bugs you.  (plus I'll get a laugh when I hear folks say JAMS server...)
